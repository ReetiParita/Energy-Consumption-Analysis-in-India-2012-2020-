# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-in-India-2012-2020-
I analyzed state-wise and category-wise energy consumption trends using Python and Tableau.
 What I Did:
 ✅ Sourced raw data from data.gov.in
 ✅ Cleaned and structured large datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
 ✅ Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau with:
 ▪️ Regional & state-level comparisons
 ▪️ Consumer category breakdown (domestic, commercial, agriculture, etc.)
 ▪️ Funnel & Pareto analysis for top energy-consuming states
 ▪️ Geographic and time-based insights
📌 Tools Used: Python, Tableau, Pandas, Data.gov
💡 Key Insight: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat lead in total energy sold, with the domestic sector being the top consumer across regions.
This project helped sharpen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation — crucial for real-world business and policy decisions.
